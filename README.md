# Craftbeershop stock exporter

During the 2020 COVID pandemic, my [local brewpup](https://www.craftbeerstore.nl)
had a nice promotion: every week they would sell a small number of really nice
craft beer packages. To be sure to not miss out on this, I wrote a simple
exporter to monitor this from my K8S stack and have Prometheus/AlertManager
alert me.
